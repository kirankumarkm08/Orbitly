Niche-Specific Backend API Endpoints
Each project has a type field (launch, ecom, event, real_estate, static). APIs are scoped by project type - only relevant endpoints are available.

🛡️ Implementation Pattern
Edge Middleware resolves project type first:

ts
// In Edge Function / Server Component
const project = await getProject(projectId);
const niche = project.type; // 'launch' | 'ecom' | 'event' | 'real_estate' | 'static'

if (niche === 'launch' && endpoint === '/products') {
  return 404; // Products not available for launch projects
}

if (niche === 'static' && endpoint === '/events') {
  return 404; // Events not available for static projects
}
Builder component registry filters by niche:

ts
const componentsByNiche = {
  launch: [Countdown, WaitlistForm, HeroLaunch, SocialProof],
  ecom: [ProductGrid, ProductCard, PricingPlans, HeroProduct],
  event: [EventHero, Schedule, SpeakerGrid, RegistrationForm],
  real_estate: [PropertyGrid, PropertyCard, LeadForm, Map],
  static: [HeroStatic, Features, Testimonials, ContactForm]
};
